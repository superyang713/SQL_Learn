# this is not a script run by any program. It is SQL (SQLite) syntax for
# creating a temporary table run in sqlite3 command line.
# Note: the syntax from the course has a pair of brackets after as statement,
# which does not work for me.


create temporary table <table_name> as
    select < column names or * >
    from <table_name>
    where <condition>;


create temporary table Slippers as
    select *
    from Shoes
    where type = 'Slippers';
